# BlenderCam

Blender Cam is a tool for blender to help quickly and precicely position the camera for ease of use.

### ONLY USE FUNCTIONS IN MAIN

### EPR (Eight Point Render)

EightPointRender renders images from each face and corner. To use it, move your camera to the first image capture location, then run the script. It will take 8 pictures, each 45 degrees apart from the last, giving you an orbital view of the object.

### Center

Centers the camera on the x-axis then moves it to the specified y and z coordinates. Y must be greater than 0 since that will set the orbit radius for 
the EPR function.
